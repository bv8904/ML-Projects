# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to **ML-Projects** — a centralized repository that houses multiple machine learning projects built using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and popular ML libraries. Each project is self-contained, well-documented, and showcases practical implementation of data science workflows from preprocessing to model evaluation.
