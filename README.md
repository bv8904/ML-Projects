ðŸ“§ Spam Mail Detection using Logistic Regression

This project uses a Supervised Machine Learning approach to classify email messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). Text data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer, and a Logistic Regression model is trained for binary classification.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
	â€¢	Goal: Predict whether an email message is spam or ham.
	â€¢	Model Used: Logistic Regression
	â€¢	Vectorization: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
	â€¢	Accuracy:
	â€¢	Training Accuracy: 96%
	â€¢	Testing Accuracy: 95%

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Pipeline
	1.	Data Loading:
	â€¢	Dataset includes messages and their labels.
	2.	Preprocessing:
	â€¢	Optional steps like removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing stop words.
	3.	Feature Extraction:
	â€¢	TfidfVectorizer is used to convert text messages into numerical feature vectors.
	4.	Model Training:
	â€¢	A Logistic Regression classifier is trained on the vectorized data.
	5.	Evaluation:
	â€¢	Accuracy is measured on both training and testing datasets.
