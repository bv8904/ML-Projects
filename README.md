# Submarine-Obstacle-Detection

🔊 Submarine Obstacle Detection using Sonar & Machine Learning

This project involves the development of a machine learning-based obstacle detection system for submarines using sonar data. The aim is to classify or detect obstacles underwater by analyzing the reflected sonar signals. This can enhance submarine navigation safety and assist in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operations.

🧠 Project Summary

Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) is widely used in underwater navigation due to the inability of radio waves to penetrate water. This project leverages machine learning algorithm(Logistic Regression) to analyze sonar signal data and detect the presence of obstacles such as rocks, shipwrecks, or sea floor features. The model is trained on sonar signal characteristics and predicts the likelihood of an obstacle in the submarine’s path.
